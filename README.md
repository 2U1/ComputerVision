## Assignment1
### Sphere.ipynb
The file is for **Lambertian reflectance** on the hemisphere.<br>
It includes an image of fixed light vector and video for moving light vectors.
### Renderer.ipynb
The file is for **Camera Calibration**.
It includes the image of fixed camera external position and, images of moving camera external positions.

## Assginment2
